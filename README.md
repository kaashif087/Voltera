#  Overview

VOLTERA is an AI-powered Battery Intelligence Platform designed to understand, analyze, predict, and optimize battery usage through intelligent data analysis and adaptive learning.

Unlike a traditional battery monitoring application, VOLTERA continuously learns user behavior, charging habits, battery health, and application usage to provide personalized recommendations and intelligent battery management.

The long-term vision is to transform VOLTERA into a fully adaptive AI assistant capable of making context-aware battery decisions based on user habits.
